To start, let me just say that I was upgrading from a RTX 3050, so the performance increase to me was massive and because of that I acknowledge my review might be a bit biased because of that fact. Whereas others might be upgrading more often, this was a big upgrade for me. Mind you, I was used to playing games with an absolutely terrible 1050 Ti for years and had only just started getting better GPUs.But anyways, this card runs pretty much all my games at maximum settings without breaking a sweat. I don't know if it's because of my cooling setup or the performance of the card alone, but I was able to play Control on maximum settings with a high frame rate (to be measured) and the card only got as hot as 41C. To me that's incredibly performant. Minecraft with shaders on Ultra settings and using a 512x resource pack with uncapped FPS, my FPS was regularly above 300fps and I don't think it went above 50C at any point. I have yet to try MC with a 2048x resource pack. Again, I'm very satisfied with the performance and I have yet more games to test it on.But the big problem with this GPU is the cost. While I would expect a higher price point because this is the upper of the mid-range GPUs or maybe even the lower of the high-range, the price burns a hole in my wallet. Without the Amazon big prime day deals and the sign up bonus from the Amazon Prime Visa card, I likely would have not gone for this card. Overall I spent about $711 on this card which shot a big hole in my spending budget. But you can't really fault this card for its performance, but you can certainly fault it for its price.Overall, if you're open to spending more on a GPU and you're a solid team green, I think you would find some good value in this card. It's performant and in the tests I've run it's also not too bad at dissipating heat.  You'll probably get some good years of high quality gaming off of this GPU.

The 40 series is worth upgrading to, in the end.  The 4070Ti was the best price/performance/power consumption ratio by far, so much so that it was a no brainer for me to settle for it over the 4090.  I'm keeping this review shorter than I normally would, since even though I'm an expert at this point I think im just gonna give the main points here and not get overly specific.1)To be competetive in the new AI machine learning world nvidia has a distinct advantage, I'm glad im not struggling with a higher specced AMD card without the damn drivers to give me all the massive speed and efficiency increases that these NVIDIA drivers give me, period.  Sry I love AMD too and my chip is nothing other than the meaty and equally mighty Threadripper, but Iove and need are two different things and I need performance and compatibility guaranteed out of anything I pay 800 bucks for.2)Since I'm developing AI based products my mileage will vary from anyone buying this to play a videogame with, all I can say is I wish i had 800 bucks to waste on videogames lol.  I'm sure the card is a beast on videogames too but i honestly just wouldn't know, I did a vanity benchmark on some free new TombRaider game that I'll never play and was pleased that the fps was through the roof at highest settings and stopped to reminisce an actually play in some ultrasmooth Borderlands before I got back to work.3)The price :(4)Amazon extended me some credit to buy it over a few payments, so these past four months have been the most productive months in my company's history due to being able to afford this equipment that has been performing solidly and reliably nonstop almost 24/7 since purchase.5)Finally, the 1800 dollar question.  Do I regret, after 4 months buying this unit over the 4900?  The honest answer is this:  Yes, but hell no.  Yes, If I had a card twice as fast as this one I wouldn't burst into tears of sadness.  But no, I would burst into tears of sadness if it cost me my only remaining kidney what am I supposed to pee with NVIDIA and AMD?  Does the 4900 come with a mechanical kidney or at least a promo code towards one instead of FIFA 2026?  If so then ok I wish I would've bought the 4900 even thought it would have cost twice the power to use 24/7, so my power company will be twice as happy.  I honestly dont know, if I have more customers then the 4090 may become a necessity, but I'm not looking forward to it.6)There u have it, I hope even though it only covered the basics, like yes if you get it for machine learning you will be very glad you did and have a card that is more than capable of cranking out professional production level product with efficiency, speed, power savings, economical, plug and play compatibility with every thing type of performance.  you're welcome.  Would not recommend to my competition.

I've now owned this 4070 ti for 6 months and was put into my very first build. Out of the box, the 4070 ti was perfect and has had zero issues thus far. No coil whine, no heat issues, no problems at all. It's sleek and fits well in my Lian Li o11 Dynamic XL (uses 3 slots with plenty of space left).The big concern I had initially was with the 12gb 192-bit memory it was fixed with. I will state that I was incorrect and have not run into a big issue with quality concerns running at my usual 2560x1440 (I am using two 1440p monitors/170ghz each). I play Apex Legends, COD, NBA 2K, DAYZ, Fortnite, and more. All games didn't push that 12gb to a level of concern or come up short on performance. I also frame-lock to my refresh rate of 170ghz and in all games but Fortnite I achieve that 170fps (Fortnite is 100-130fps). I will note that all games are put on max settings or very near max settings. I will end with the fact I've also tried this at 4k output with a 4k monitor and it still ran superbly, though there was a slight dip in frames.My main components are this 4070 ti, an i7 13700k CPU, MSI Z790 Tomahawk Pro board, and two sticks of 16gb GSkill Trident Z5, just so you have an idea of my setup.I highly recommend this for a 2k and most 4k output setups.

This arrived completely undamaged! I had a very nice unboxing experience thanks to the way this card is packaged. You know you bought something of quality when you open the box.This card was installed in a new build which is as follows:Ryzen 7800x3d CPUMSI Pro B650-P Wifi MotherboardDeepCool AK620 Zero Dark32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 6000mhz AMD Memory (CMH32GX5M2B6000Z30K) @5200mhz ExpoAsus Tuf RTX 4070 Ti Super 16GB Video CardCreative Audigy FX V2 Sound CardCorsair RM1200e 1200W Power Supply (Overkill I know)Fractal Meshify 2 RGB Case (Amazing Case)Windows 11 HomeUpgraded from the following system:Intel i7 11700 CPUMSI Z490-A Pro MotherboardCorsair H100x 240mm AIO32 GBs Corsair Vengeance DDR4 PC3600 MemoryNvidia RTX 3070 FECreative Audigy FX V2 Sound CardCorsair RM750 750W Power SupplyCorsair 4000D Case (Excellent Case Also)Windows 11 HomeIt performs flawlessly! The upgrade from an RTX 3070 is massive. Along with the CPU upgrade to a 7800x3d, my frame rates at 1440p have more than doubled. I have a 165 HZ MSI Mag274QRF-QD monitor that I limit to 163 HZ globally. Most of my currently installed games (World of Warcraft, Dying Light 2, FallOut 76, FarCry 6, GTAV, Fortnight, etc) are getting frame rates at or near the 163 HZ limit, at ultra settings (No Ray Tracing or DLSS 3 except in Dying Light 2, and that game looks amazing and still gets over 100 fps!).I am also using a second MSI monitor (Mag274 @1080P) for chat and communications programs while gaming, and as usual with Nvidia video cards this has no problems with 2 monitors, both using display port.The Asus Tuf RTX 4070 Ti Super never gets very warm. I think once I saw it at 60C. Its basically always in the 50C range while gaming. I am sure the 140mm fans of the Meshify 2 RGB help this.The card itself is quite big, and feels very well built and sturdy. The anti sag support that Asus included worked well, but I switched it to a beefier aftermarket version that I like better.I only have one con, and that is the cost. To be a PC gamer is very expensive, and this is the biggest expense! It is a lot of money. I think most people who purchase cards like this, myself included, are planning on using it a long time to help offset the cost somewhat.The warranty is 3 years, I mistakenly thought it was 4 years. Perhaps wishful thinking :)I am planning on enjoying this card for at least 4 to 5 years. At 1440p I am sure it will be just fine for that amount of time. Other than the cost I have no cons, it is a fantastic video card and the best one I have ever owned!Please Note: I will most likely will be receiving a 90 day warranty extension from Asus for writing this review.

I bought this to upgrade from a 2060. I've always been behind the curve and with my recent computer upgrade, the 2060 wasn't cutting it anymore. My set-up is a MSI Z-790 DDR4 Tomahawk, 13gen i5, 3600 C16 RAM. It's nice to play WZ3, the only game I play, at close to 200fps with everything on. Game is smooth and I can see detail, which is what I was after.It's not the cheapest, but it's not the most expensive. As of writing this review, anything better and cost effective is down the road a ways. I was considering a 7900XT, but I've always had zero trouble with my NVidia cards and the issues, however small, with AMD drivers kept me away from them.Now, if Activision could get it together and make WZ3 run without it screwing up, things would be perfect.

The ProArt 4070 ti is a beautiful card. It's quiet at load, fits in a lot of ITX cases (if you're info SFF), and, at the right price, offers a solid value proposition. Unfortunately, it's rarely ever discounted, and now competes with the less expensive 4070 Super, which is a very strong competitor with the 4070 ti.

Very cool, quiet with insane build quality feels very premium due to the all metal shroud/backplate, very little coil whine barely noticeable without headset onTemps sit around 64c on max load during games with VRM Junction at 72c

UPDATE 2/2/24:  Obviously my card is damaged, but how much?  Perhaps it might not be as bad as I thought it would be.  Further research came up with an explanation to the issues where the temperature sensor #1 determines when to turn all the gpu fans on for the video card but the other two gpu temperature sensors reach 66C when the 55C is reached at the controlling temperature to start the fans.What I think may have been happening is that the AI ASUS overclocking in the bios on my motherboard was actually underclocking the video card to protect it because the controlling #1 temperature sensor was failing to turn the fans on when they were actually needed.  Hence some of the malfunctioning underclocking where the fps dropped to 35 fps or so and the MHZ speed drops from 2860 or 2880 to 600 mhz to 800 mhz simultaneously was done by ASUS AI overclocking to protect the two overheating zones in the ROG 4070 TI OC.  When it underclocks the gpu the temperatures are so low that the fans never turn on because it needs to be that cool for the two overheating parts that should turn the fans on at 55C.If this is true then the gpu is not quite as damaged as I had thought because the ASUS AI overclocking in the bios was to blame for some of the malfunctioning by underclocking, but not all of it.  Thus, the damage may be on durability issues more than functional overclocking parts not working to the point that it no longer works normally.UPDATE 1/31/24:  The video card temperature sensors and cooling are defective on my video card, but it was very hard to diagnose.  As a result, the cooling probes do not turn on the fans when they should and two the cooling fans do not work correctly due to some unknown cooling defect.  Now I am stuck with a seriously damaged video card and cannot make a return for full refund or exchange.  It takes extended intense gaming for the defects to show up which is why I had three computer repair home visits made to make sure the card was defective before making a replacement or return.I hope an Amazon senior manager reads this because Amazon policy was not honored.  I had to have three home visits from the manager of the local computer repair shop try to figure out what was wrong with the video card, and he could not make his last visit to my home until Jan. 30th.  I thought that was ok because I was told by customer service that I had until Jan. 31st to make a return.Now I was not allowed to return the broken item in exchange for a new one because customer service said Jan. 31 was too late to be covered.  The return date was listed on the order as ""eligible for return THROUGH Jan. 31"" which means until the end of January.  Amazon customer service said that meant the return period ends Jan 30 when I tried to return it on Jan. 31st like I was promised.  Now I cannot get a replacement or return with it being damaged for a full refund because it has to be in new condition for that and would be subject to restocking fees even if it were deemed working, and the refund would much be less if damaged.The cooling defects are so complicated that it probably would not have the defective issue noticed by simple testing.  The problem is that temperature probe #1 determines when the cooling fans reach 55C to start the cooling fans, but the other two temperature probes read 11C hotter than probe #1 does due to cooling defects.  Hence two of the three temperature zones reach 66C before the cooling fans turn on to start the cooling process.I was told by amazon customer service that I had until Jan. 31 to make a return and when I did, I was told that it was one day too late to get a replacement or make the return for a full refund.  What I wanted was a replacement sent to me so that I would have my defective video card replaced with a new video card while returning the defective one as promised earlier when I first reported the problems.Amazon should have said that the last day to make a return was Jan. 30 if Jan. 31 was too late to make a replacement or full refund of damaged item instead of saying ""return eligible through Jan. 31.""  Thus, I should have had instructions that said ""returns must be completed Jan. 30"" if that were true or Jan. 31 was still good because that it the way it is written and was promised.  Furthermore, the instruction of ""eligible for return through Jan. 31. remained on the order UNTIL Feb. 1, so amazon refused to follow their own written policy and hung up on me 5 times trying to get that policy honored.I finally asked their supervisor to make an exception for me due the misunderstandings of what ""eligible for return through Jan. 31"" meant on the return window and was earlier promised that Jan. 31st was the last day.  He refused the courtesy exception because he said they were not allowed to make any exceptions whatsoever.  That is not true because I have had several exceptions made over the years.I then asked to talk to an escalations manager to appeal and was not allowed to dispute the return date misunderstanding to a senior manager.  Amazon customer service sometimes does not seem speak English well enough to correctly write and honor their promises or make exceptions when that happens.Furthermore, I had to use a Qcode and drop it off the next day 15 miles the away at the UPS Store by Feb.1.  I CANNOT do that under the circumstances due to factors beyond my control.  I was not given 10 days or so to send it back with a return label like it normally would be done.Now I have to return the video card to ASUS for warranty where I must pay shipping fees and not have use of my computer during the process which is not possible under the circumstances.  Amazon usually has great customer service but utterly failed me this time.Please Amazon, reconsider sending me a free replacement for my defective video card so I can keep using my computer and not have to pay ASUS shipping fees because the return policy was not written nor honored in its plain English meaning with no exceptions made for misunderstandings over what plain English means.  The return policy should have said that the last day to make a return was Jan. 30 if that was true.Original review:I love the card but it immediately started dying due to inadequate power from my 900 watt supply.  I checked the power requirements from the Asus site and only 750 watts is listed as a power requirement.  Asus is terribly wrong because it needs 1200 watts to run correctly.I have been building computers for well over 15 years and I know what a video card does when dying.  I have had many video cards go bad because they were not built to last when used as directed due to engineering problems.  This card started dying and collapsed in less than 10 hours of serious gaming.  The frames per second dropped to 30 fps and the mhz dropped to under 600 over and over again even after the computer was restarted.I put in the Asus THOR 1200 watt platinum 2 power supply AND IT SAVED THE VIDEO CARD FROM DYING.UPDATE:  I am still having issues with the video card.1)  The card crashes under heavy loads and runs 35 fps to 45 fps at 600 mhz to 800 mhz when it does.  Usually it runs 90 fps to 150 fps at 2860 mhz to 2890 mhz so the drops go unexplained as to why the fps AND mhz drop simultaneously.  My old ASUS ROG STRIX 1660 Super Overclocked worked almost as good with 70 fps to 90 fps at 1935 mhz so the gaming upgrade was disappointing.  However, the 8K sound output is amazing with 4K You Tube remastered music videos through my OPPO 203 4K hdmi upconverter/blu ray player using 8K hdmi cables.  I have almost 7K watts rms THX certified audio output using DTS:X Ultra if you count my three BIC PL300 subwoofers at 1400 watts peak each.  Everybody near me wants me to play music on the weekend.2)  The computer locks up and the mouse does not work for several minutes when adding my OPPO 203 as a second screen to play music.3)  The mouse cuts in and out with lag periodically for a second or so keeping the pointer frozen when clicking on things when the card is under moderate load.I need to do an RMA on the card despite the fact that it improves one of my games well with few problems since I got the new ASUS Platinum power supply.  However, the lingering issues makes it worth the RMA since ASUS makes you pay for the warranty shipping.  IF it turns out that their card is defective then they should have to pay for the shipping and only charge you shipping for returning it if it is not covered by warranty instead of the other way around.

Coming from a 2070 / 1080p long time setup this thing just blows everything out of the water I have thrown at it now that I've moved to 1440p.  Upgraded my core system parts 2 years ago, intel 12700k CPU, 64GB memory, NVM's, 850 PSU, etc.  Kept the 2070 and it was perfectly fine at 1080p, but I knew it was time for me to move to the 1440p world.  Where the 2070 just couldn't deal with 1440p effectively, I'm completely topping off my FPS with a new ASUS 240 monitor in many games now with this card.  The difference in clarity is just stunning at 1440p when the FPS is smooth.  I'd say most modern  games, even intensive ones, are hitting 100-150+ FPS without missing a beat.  Another massive selling point was the fact it's very very quiet.  It ramps up slighltly under load, you can hear the airflow increasing, but it's nothing disturbing and if you game with headsets, you'll never hear it.  Bottom line if you have the horsepower core system guts, this thing doesn't dissapoint.  If I had any CON, it's large...larger than I would have suspected. Measure your case for sure.  Lastly, get a proper support for it, so you avoid future sag concerns.  I have an old Rosewill THOR case I have used for easily 7-8 years, which is a monster with space, and I still found myself sweating a little due to the size.
